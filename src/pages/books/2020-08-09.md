description: "In The Sovereign Individual, Davidson and Rees-Mogg explore the greatest economic and political transition in centuriesâ€”the shift from an industrial to an information-based society. This transition, which they have termed 'the fourth stage of human society,' will liberate individuals as never before, irrevocably altering the power of government. This outstanding book will replace false hopes and fictions with new understanding and clarified values."
