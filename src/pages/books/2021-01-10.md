description: "In his classic reference book The Elements of Style (1920), William Strunk Jr. explains that writers must first understand writing’s rules before they can break them. He offers clear, instructive advice on proper sentence composition. Strunk composed this book in 1918 and self-published before seeking traditional publication. The book was originally intended to be a textbook for his own English class, but the principles proved to be widely useful. It was later edited and developed by a former student, E. B. White."
